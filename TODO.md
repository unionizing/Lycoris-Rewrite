Juanito's good suggestions:

- Add Parry and Dodge Vent option + Chance slider
    - If both Parry and Dodge vent are enabled, it should do either or
- Show Players on map
- Chain of Perfection counter
- Fix No Blur not working with low water
- No Blind
- Fortitude farm (spams dialogue with Brutus, believe me, exploiters will love any farm)
- pause any Attribute Farm once it detects a power up
- Maestro farm (should be easy since you have all the systems you need to do it, just have it spam M1 and/r or moves if you're feeling fancy)
- Webhooks for fishing (golden swordfish + paired with autoloot to notify relics) and maestro farm if you add it
- Instalog Keybind + Server hop Keybind
- Auto Roll Cancel (for Float Like a Butterfly or Death From Above)
- No Roll Fatigue (slider for how much less roll fatigue you want) (patched on legacy but maybe try unpatching it on rewrite)
- Priority Dodge Frame (don't know how useful this is but comp players liked this feature)
- Rare NPC/Mob Notifier (Silhuett, Grudge, Ministry Heartspiller, Maljuror)
