# Deepwoken Rewrite
**The timing and module list were not able to be auto-generated properly due to some other irrelevant changes.**
*The new 'Untrained' fist style should be completely in including the critical.*
*Trial orbs should now be "relatively" fixed? I've heard they're bugged for normal players though.*

**Any new features?**
```diff
+ (added) Added 'Mark User Holding Sack' to Player ESP
+ (added) Bag ESP now works on VOI Sacks
+ (added) Chest ESP now works on VOI Chests
- (bug fix) Should have fixed Abnormal ESP sizes by making cache invalidation more lenient
```
