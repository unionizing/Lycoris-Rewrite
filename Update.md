It attempts to parry instead of block with some added information in the notification.
**Base combat has been changed heavily, report any bad hitboxes.**

*A lot of these moves that were changed now have the 'Hyperarmor' flag turned on.*

**New features?**
```diff
- (bug fix) Animation speed changer cycled through many random speeds in one timing
- (bug fix) Updated info spoofing to use the new pathing
- (bug fix) Info spoofing now spoofs player properties
- (removed) "User is in hit animation" check is now removed
- (removed) Temporarily removed using the map position to locate far away players (32k+ studs)
+ (added) Animation speed changer has new switch between speeds feature
+ (added) Aggressive auto feint type which ignores all player attacking checks and functions like Legacy does
+ (added) Entity ESP rework
+ (added) Hide Allies On ESP
+ (added) Player list whitelisting
+ (added) Timing probabilities feature
+ (added) Damage indicators
+ (changed) Auto feint now respects hyperarmor (this caused auto feint to be useless in PVE) (this data may be missing for some timings; please report if so)
+ (changed) Auto feint now runs another check a bit before the timing to combat feinting latency
+ (changed) Whitelisted players are now considered allies
```
*Info spoofing does not prevent you from hovering over the spectate list. If you do so, it will show real usernames.*

*Your commit ID should == "asdasdasd" when the update is fully pushed to you.*
