# Coding Style
Please stick to PascalCase for tables and camelCase for everything else.

For constants, please use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. 

Follow the general style of code - avoid nesting & look at other files to see how things are done.

Make OOP / class files the way which is shown in the codebase.

# Downloading Releases
The 'Preprocessed' version contains encrypted timings and modules; as if you were a normal buyer. This version is 'Plug And Play' for ready use.

The 'Bundled' version contains no timings and modules. They must be synced with 'WorkspaceSync.py' with the proper arguments to load them properly. This version is for development and contains a builder.

# Code Smell
A majority of the code will be very clean.

Some code will be especially ugly. The modules are there for rapid development. So, they are extremely smelly. A lot of mistakes were done during development which we hoped to correct in the future.

The 'Ui Library' code is very ugly. We did not care about that file because it was an external dependency.
